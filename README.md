# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
Final Project was given by Natural Language Processing class.

A group project that decided to do the "Sentiment Analysis" problem and try to solve them with the material that is gotten from NLP. To solve the problem, we use a simple approach to clean the data and run the data because of the massive data that we got. Because of that, we got a low accuracy as a result.
